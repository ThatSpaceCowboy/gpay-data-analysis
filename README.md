# Google Pay Transaction Data Analysis

This project provides a Python script to extract and analyse specific information from HTML files and save it to a CSV file. It is designed to handle HTML content with specific classes and structures.


I've always wanted to analyse my spendings and classify them what goes where in real time. 
I use Google Pay for almost all my transactions but I figured early that there's no way to process these transactions in real time.
This repo is a product of my dissapointment towards Google for not providing the transaction data in csv format ðŸ™„.
